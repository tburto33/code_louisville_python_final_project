# DnD Character Generator
My final project for the Code Louisville Python course.
For new DnD players building a character can be the hardest step when getting started. I created a small console application that will make that process easier.
Using a few simple methods/functions, some dicts, user input, and DnD wizardry I have a basic character creator. Choose your name, sex, race and class (based on descriptions provided), and it will give you stats at the end of the program to use for your campaign.

***PDF option works and can be found in project folder after creation, but is still in progress.***

***Must be in venv to run:
1) CD into project/venv/Scripts
2) Type "activate" into command line
3) CD to project folder
4) Type "python run.py"
5) Make a character and have fun adventurer!***
