# code_louisville_python_final_project
My final project for the Code Louisville Python course.
For new DnD players building a character can be the hardest step when getting started. I created a small console application that will make that process easier.
Using a few simple methods/functions, some dicts, user input, and DnD wizardry I have a basic character creator. Choose a race and class based on descriptions provided, and it will give you stats at the end of the program to use for your campaign.

Features:
- Character Class
- Multiple dictionaries/lists to store/retrieve data from
- Multiple functions/methods used throughout program
- Loops for choosing character class and race
- Calculates and displays character ability/skill stats

In Progress:
- Allow program to create a fully random character
- Export character to pdf to save character

Other Features I plan to add:
- Cantrip/1st Level Spell lists
- Simple Weapon lists
- Build into web app using Django
