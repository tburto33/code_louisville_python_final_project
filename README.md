# code_louisville_python_final_project
My final project for the Code Louisville Python course.
For new DnD players building a character can be the hardest step when getting started. I created a small console application that will make that process easier.
Using a few simple methods/functions, some dicts, and DnD wizardry I have a basic character creator. Choose a race and class based on descriptions provided, and
it will give you stats at the end of the program to use for your campaign.

In Progress:
- Project is still in early stages, this is just my MVP
- Still needs validation
- Some code refactoring for simplification

Other Features I want to add:
- Display skills stats
- Name generator
- Ability to upload data to PDF
